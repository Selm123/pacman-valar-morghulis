1. main things: health, age, fortune, achivements, happiness. Born with random health (1-10), random money (-1000000--1000000)
2. young to old (old move slower and get more damage and ghosts are regenrated faster, full screen of ghosts), born with random health points (1-10) and die any way, difference is happy points and achievement points
2. ghosts 4 horseman disease poverty accident lonliness. Before health points reduced to zero, captured by ghosts would not die instancely but reduce health points and kill the ghost and show "not today!". Ghosts number are 4 before age 18 (regenerate after been killed by pacman)
